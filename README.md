# Mission 1

This mission/project focuses on creating API and testing the services provided by the API called functions

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ajleira11/Level5Mission1.gi
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. make sure that there is no other file running on localhost:4000 to make it work

## Usage

- `npm run dev` - this will run your server at localhost:4000 which is the default on my code
- you can use the api directly in your postman where you need to input some data as JSON format.
- in API 1 you need to input the following on your postman under body as a json {"model": string, "year": number}
- same as API 2 you just need to change the input as {"claim_history": string};
